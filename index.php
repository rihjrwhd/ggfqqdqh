                <p class="lead text-center">1 - Participation:</p>

                <p>Any individuals may participate in this service called "Automation Tech" who are older than 18 years of age, with the full capacity to enter into agreements, and who have read and accepted these Conditions of Use (this document may be printed and stored by visitors and users), and, where applicable, are registered as users and comply with the obligations inherent to the status of partners.</p>

                <p>Any registration establishing that the user does not comply with the conditions for participation (due, among other reasons, to being a minor, or not accepting its conditions) will not be considered valid. Therefore, the user, even having provided their data, will not be considered a registered user, nor will their data be stored in any way.</p>



                <hr>



                <p class="lead text-center">2 - Description of the service:</p>

                <p>By way of "Automation Tech", "The Organiser" offers a system of information in the arts and sciences of divination, especially astrology, numerology, taromancy and horoscopy.</p>

                <p>Said system of information may have two varieties:</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>free services in matters of the arts and sciences of divination, especially astrology, numerology, taromancy and horoscopy by email.</li>

                    <li>paid customized services, offering individualized products and/or services in matters of the arts and sciences of divination, especially astrology, numerology, taromancy and horoscopy.</li>

                </ul>

                <p>The distinction between both types will be made, in any event, in a manner that leaves no question about its nature, and it will include the applicable terms and conditions</p>

                <p>In any case, the information that is offered, whether it is free or compensation is provided by way of a donation and/or payment, shall not be considered medical, legal, real estate, psychological, emotional or economic/financial advice or advice of any other type. Furthermore, it shall not be used as a foundation for making decisions. It should not replace the advice of other professionals. It is of a recreational, cultural and playful nature, in an esoteric and/or spiritual setting, providing a different perspective about the aspects that are the subject of the consultation and information.</p>

                <p>All products or services that, where applicable, are offered by this website and/or the subsequent communications thereof will be digital, with the exception of possible telephone consultations, being sent to their recipient at their email address that, where applicable, has been provided.</p>



                <hr>



                <p class="lead text-center">3 - Operation of the service:</p>

                <p>"Automation Tech" allows free access (beyond the costs arising, where applicable, from accessing the Internet) without the need to provide any personal data or payment.</p>

                <p>As an option, users may choose, subject to the expressed approval of these Conditions of Use, for a fortune telling performed by "Automation Tech" that will be sent to the email address provided by the user at no cost.</p>

                <p>Said fortune telling, like the information provided directly by "Automation Tech", shall not be considered, medical, legal, real estate, psychological, emotional or economic/financial advice or advice of any other sort. Furthermore, it shall not be used for making decisions. It should not replace the advice of other professionals. It is of a recreational, cultural and playful nature, in an esoteric and/or spiritual setting, providing a different perspective about the aspects that are the subject of the consultation and information. It is performed base on variables arising from the personal data of the user.</p>

                <p>In addition to requesting the personal data necessary for rendering the service (which is the purpose of their request), throughout the registration process, or even at the end of it, the user may be offered to enter into an agreement regarding specific extra services, digital media products and/or promotions or services of third parties, which are always additional and optional.</p>

                <p>Under no circumstances will they involve services that use communication systems with additional charges.</p>



                <hr>



                <p class="lead text-center">4 - Mechanics of the Service:</p>

                <p>In relation to the free service, it consists of fortune telling customised to the user, sent for free by email to the user. The user may subsequently receive new readings, fortune tellings and/or other information of interest to them.</p>

                <p>Additionally and optionally, the user may purchase specific customized products or services. In said cases, and in accordance with the conditions of the product/service that, where applicable, is specified in the corresponding section of the website or in the commercial communications that are sent regarding the matter, the user must provide a method of payment for said products/services. In any event, the digital nature of said products/services shall be taken into account for the purposes of the right to withdrawal, which is indicated in the last paragraph of this point, being inapplicable given the nature of the commissioned products/services after they are provided.</p>

                <p>In any event, in order to proceed with payment for any additional product or service and the Client shall follow each and every one of the instructions that are shown on the corresponding page or in the commercial communications that are sent regarding the matter. Payment of the price for the products and/or services may only be done by credit or debit cards or other forms of payment that are indicated at that time. Said methods of payment will be subject to confirmation and authorisation by the issuing institutions. However, if said institution does not authorise payment, the purchase procedure that was initiated may not continue, and the request will be automatically cancelled, being understood that the purchase of the product and/or service was not executed.</p>

                <p>Charges of the price for the specific products and/or services, for the shipment service (where applicable), in addition to any other taxes that are applicable, will be made at the time the request is formalised.</p>

                <p>Charges to an account by way of a credit or debit card will always be done in United States dollars or in euros for the amounts indicated at that time, as stated on the website. For informational purposes (which are not exhaustive or official), "Automation Tech" provides, prior to and simultaneously with the commissioning of its products and/or services, a tool for converting currency performed by independent third parties for better and greater information to users and Clients. In any event, due to the fluctuations of the currency market and the free adoption of exchange rates by banking institutions, or due to the existence of commissions by the banking institutions, it is possible that the amounts effectively charged in currency different from United States dollars or euros will slightly differ from those that are indicated for informational purposes, for which "Automation Tech" is completely uninvolved, who guarantees that it only generates payment orders for the amount that is nominally indicated.</p>

                <p>As an electronic payment system, "Automation Tech" has installed an electronic commerce payment gateway. All of the data provided to "Automation Tech" for these purposes is encrypted in order to guarantee its maximum security, and it is stored on a secure server certified according to the "Secure Socket Layer" protocol. Under no circumstances will the data from bank cards be stored in the files of "Automation Tech", but rather, where applicable, and for the sole purposes of the contractual process that is executed, by the bank payment gateway.</p>

                <p>A period of 14 days is established from the time of the purchase to exercise the right of withdrawal. In any event, the right of withdrawal is excluded in any cases where, due to the nature of the goods/services that are the subject of the purchase, it is impossible to perform, including, specifically: Products provided according to the specifications of the consumer or that are clearly customised and/or digital files, supplied electronically, that can be downloaded or reproduced immediately for their permanent use. This aspect must be taken into account especially given that, unless stated otherwise, all products that, where applicable, are offered by way of this website and/or subsequent communications that are sent due to said website, will be digital, except for possible telephone consultations, being sent to the recipient by way of an email address that, where applicable, they have provided.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>In all cases, and in addition to taking action with this third party, if, at one time, you receive a commercial communication, from any origin whatever that, in your opinion, is, or could be inadequate, whether it concerns its contents or the fact of not having obtained your agreement or for any other reason, and that you wish to file a complaint, we ask you to please send us a copy of this commercial communication (while keeping, as much as possible, the information contained in the heading) to the email address <a href="mailto:contact@automationtech.info">contact@automationtech.info</a>.
